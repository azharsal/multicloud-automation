How to run:

I made and ran this program on a Macbook with MacOS. To run it, I run the command "python3 automate.py", where the azure.conf and gcp.conf files are in teh same directory. All files generated from this program will also be found in the same directory.


Specifications:

If an image, resource group does not exist, or the name is invalid, the program shall simply inform the user and move on without attempting to create the VM.
If the user does not enter a admin-password field in the vm then they shall be prompted to enter it in the terminal by the cli.
User can also speicify a port to be open by adding the "port" argument to the .conf file with a number attached. E.g 80 for http.


Addtional arguments:

For Azure, the two additional arguments that can be speicified are "vm_size" and "disk_size".
For GCP, the two additional arguments that can be specified are "machine_type" and "disk_size".

Both of these are commented out in the .conf files attached with the submission.
